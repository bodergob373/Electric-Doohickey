title: Electric Doohickey
author: Jonathan Itoh
description: A prototype electric vehicle to gain experience and design the electric system of an ethanol-electric hybrid I want to build in the future (and to build a fun go-kart). It's an array of 20 Nissan Leaf batteries managed by a BMS to power a 12kW hub motor (or a temporary hoverboard motor until I could afford it).

# June 25th: First Research

Used ChatGPT for researching 

**Total time spent: 2h**



# July 11th: Starting the Submission

I made the GitHub repository and named it this because it's a goofy contraption.

**Total time spent: 10 min**




# July 1st: Metal
I looked around for scrap pipes and found curved segments of an old trampoline frame. I tore it apart, measured the segments, set up the 3D workspace, and modeled them. I had a hard time modeling the curve so I measured the pipe's length, made a circle with a circumference 12 times that, and got a 12th segment. Because they're curved, an oval frame would be simple.

# July 2nd: Designing
I measured parts the 10" wheels and modeled them. I also got their inner diameter and found that Home Depot had perfect 5/8" threaded rods. Then, I measured the battery modules, double checked them with online dimensions, and modeled them. I looked at how batteries are usually wired in series and parallel and made the 10S2p design with the battery modules.

# July 3rd: Designing 2
Using bus bars that go across the batteries in a straight line would be simpler, so I rotated every other parallel group and added bus bars. For the kart, I decided to use 4 curved segments in an oval. For simplicity, the steering is only 1 wheel. It's not a bike so I put the other wheels on the sides to keep it upright. I designed the fork, arranged the frame quarters, positioned the seat and steering, added foot bars, designed the battery frame, and put the side wheels at an angle.

# July 22nd: Cutting
Because I have a limited number of straight short tubes and longer straight ones were slightly bent, I planned out what pipes will be cut and where. Before I will start cutting them, I laid the main frame quarters together and confirmed the dimensions. Then, I cut off the ends of them so that they could be easily be connected and be stronger.
