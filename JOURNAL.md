description: A prototype electric vehicle to gain experience and design an electric system for an ethanol-electric hybrid I want to build in the future. It's an array of 20 Nissan Leaf batteries managed by a BMS to power a motor controller connected to a 12kW hub motor (or a temporary hoverboard motor).
